    "text": "In Oregon, state and local revenues are pooled together and redistributed to school districts based on a funding formula. Approximately 60% of the total education budget comes from the state’s share, making it a critical revenue source for most districts. The State School Fund (SSF) allocates lump-sum funding to districts based on the number of resident students, adjusted for differential needs as specified by the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS 327.008). Students with disabilities are double-weighted in the funding formula, with districts guaranteed double-weighted funding for up to 11% of their student population. Other student groups, such as students classified as English Language Learners or those qualifying for Free-or-reduced price lunch are also proportionately weighted in the formula. While state allocations are tied to student demographics, districts have the flexibility to use these revenues as they see fit.\nAnother state fiscal policy to support students with disabilities is the High-Cost Disability Fund, which reimburses districts for expenses exceeding $30,000 per special education student (the cap was at $25,000 from 2003-2005). Each year, a portion of the SSF, amounting to less than 5% of the total appropriation, is designated for this fund. If statewide claims exceed the available funds, reimbursements are prorated across districts.\nIn this analysis, I will describe descriptive trends in district enrollment, districts’ state-funding allocation, district revenue, and district expenditure related to students with disabilities whose services cost more than a given threshold and are paid by the grant called High-Cost Disability Fund."

However, there is substantial variation in enrollment between districts.\n\n\nTrends in Enrollment Across Years with Districts &gt; 30k enrollment Highlighted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three biggest districts - Portland, Salem-Keizer, and Beaverton have more than 35000 students.\n\n\nTrends in Enrollment Across Years with Districta 13-20k enrollment Highlighted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA handful of districts - including Eugene 4J have more than 13000 students.\n\n\nTrends in Enrollment Across Years with Districts &lt;10 students Highlighted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 13% of school districts have less than 100 students.\n\n\nTrends in State - Subgroup Enrollment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 40% of Oregon’s students are in programs or demographic categories that get additional funding weights from the state-funding formula. The three biggest groups are students under poverty, students served in special education and in English language programs.\nIn 2011, about 16% of the all students were under poverty, 14% of all students were in special education programs and 9% of students were in the ESL programs. In 2024, students served in special education was the biggest group at 15% followed by students under poverty and students in ELP at around 12%. About 1% of the students are in other programs.\n\n\nTrends in District - Subgroup Enrollment Across Years\nNext, we look at the trends percentage of subgroup representation across districts over time.\n\n\n[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[4]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[5]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[6]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents in special education (IEP or students with an Individualized Education Plans) and English language programs have been steadily growing over the years, and those classified in poverty are steadily decreasing, but there is plenty of between-district variation.\nBetween 0 to 3% of students were classified as HCD between districts between 2018 to 2022.\n\n\nTrends in District - Subgroup Enrollment by Total Enrollment For 2022\n\n\n[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[4]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[5]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[6]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor students with an IEP and student in poverty, there is variation in proportion of the subgroup relative to the school enrollment. However, the average sub-group representation by quintiles of school enrollment appears even, at between 12-16%. A handful of school districts with an enrollment of around 10 students served no special education students in their districts in 2022. Some of the low-enrollment schools have high representation of students in poverty.\nStudents in ESL programs, and those in foster care or neglected/delinquent, pregnant and parenting programs, and those eligible for reimbursements from the high-cost disability funds are more concentrated in bigger schools."

    "text": "District Funds Allocation Data\nI define allocation ratio as the ratio of weighted average daily membership to the real average daily membership. Since students with some characteristics are weighted more than 1 per the state formula, a district gets resources as if there were more students in the school. So, an allocation ratio of 2 means that districts get 2 student equivalent for every 1 real student in their district.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents in smaller school districts get more per-student revenue allocated (in student units) than students in larger districts. In the first enrollment quintile, school districts get about 4 student equivalent for each of their student. In the second quintile, school districts get about 2 student equivalent for each of their student. In larger districts, school districts get 1.3 student equivalent for each of their student."

Of the total revenue, between 28-33% came from State resources, 23-25% came from local resources, and 35-40% came from Other resources. Intermediate and federal resources accounted for the remaining.\nAlmost all of state revenue is allocated using the SSF. Local revenue could be tax levies etc. The biggest contributor to Other resources are districts’ account balance from previous years – thus, districts saved substantial money from past years. The decrease in other sourcecs over the 4 years could be related to using emergency resources in response to COVID-19 related disruptions.\nIf we remove the other sources and only consider the new money districts get, about 50% comes from state resources and 40 percent come from local resources. Between 6 to 10% percent come from federal sources.\n\n\nTrends in Per-pupil revenue by Districts based on sources\nTo be described.\n\n\n[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[4]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[5]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe: Other includes balance in the state account.\n\n\nTrends in Revenue by District Enrollment\n\n\n[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[4]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[5]]"
